# Contributing

The goal of this gem is to provide a small collection of useful, performant caches.

- To add a new kind of cache, you must convince us that it's useful
- To change a cache, you must
  - convince us that it's a useful change
  - ensure that it's well-tested
  - ensure that it's benchmarked and performant

`rake` runs the specs and `rake benchmark` runs the benchmarks (still in-progress). They are expected to pass on Ruby 2.1.3
