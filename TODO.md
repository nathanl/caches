# TODO

- Refactor LinkedList
- Add benchmarks: speed (and maybe memory usage), runnable with rake task for all cache classes. Be able to compare over the course of development (eg, version 0.0.1 vs 0.0.3). Maybe output ASCII graphs for fun.
- Add Travis CI testing
- Give all caches a way to manually invalidate a given key. Return nil if it wasn't here and the value if it was.
- Add "least used" cache class
- Define `blank?`, etc on list and caches
- Ride a skateboard and, simultaneously, shoot a potato gun
